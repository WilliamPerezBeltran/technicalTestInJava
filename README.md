# Question 1

Write a method that takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is an array of integers that has already been sorted from smallest to largest. The second parameter is an integer. The method should return the number of times the second parameter appears in the first parameter.

### Example:
If the first parameter is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]` and the second parameter is `3`, the method should return `2`.

## Part 1: Explain Your Algorithm
## Part 2: Please implement the method in Java.
